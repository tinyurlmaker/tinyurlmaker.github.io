            Each phishing email in this study was <strong>uniquely generated</strong> for the recipient using a Large Language Model (LLM). 
            The LLM retrieved <strong>publicly available information</strong> from social media platforms (Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, X) 
            and incorporated these elements into the message to increase plausibility. <br><br>
            Every generated email was reviewed by a human researcher to ensure that <strong>no harmful or inappropriate content was included</strong>, 
            but the content itself was not modified. Emails were sent from a domain belonging to Politecnico di Milano that is separate 
            from official university addresses. <br><br>
            The only data recorded during the experiment was whether a participant clicked on the link contained in the email. 
            No additional personal information or metadata (such as IP address, browser, or device) was tracked. 
            The system did not store participants' personal data beyond what was needed to generate the message.

            This was a simulated phishing attempt conducted exclusively for research purposes at 
            <strong>Politecnico di Milano, Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB), NECSTLab</strong>. 
            The study aims to understand how personalized phishing campaigns, powered by modern AI systems, may affect user behavior. <br><br>
            <strong>You are not at risk:</strong> no credentials or sensitive data were collected, and all information used to generate the phishing email 
            was deleted immediately after the message was sent. <br><br>
            If you request a <strong>personalized report</strong>, a new search will be carried out for your case, replicating the same process used 
            in the experiment. The results will be sent to your email address, and all data collected for this report will be deleted 
            immediately after delivery. <br><br>
