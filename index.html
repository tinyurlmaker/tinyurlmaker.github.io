            You are seeing this page because you agreed to participate in a research study

            Each phishing email used in this study was <strong>uniquely generated</strong> for the recipient. 
            A Large Language Model (LLM) retrieved <strong>publicly available information from social media 
            platforms</strong> (Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, X) and incorporated these elements into the 
            message to increase plausibility. <br><br>
            No private profiles, restricted sections, or direct messages were accessed. 
            The system <strong>did not</strong> store participants' personal data beyond the automated generation 
            of the message. The only information recorded during the experiment was whether the 
            recipient clicked on the link contained in the email.

            This was a simulated phishing attempt conducted exclusively for research purposes 
            at <strong>Politecnico di Milano, Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB), NECSTLab</strong>. 
            The study aims to understand how personalized phishing campaigns, powered by modern 
            AI systems, may affect user behavior. <br><br>
            <strong>You are not at risk:</strong> no credentials or sensitive data were collected, and all 
            information used to generate the phishing email was deleted immediately after the 
            message was sent. If you request a <strong>personalized report</strong>, a new search will be carried 
            out to reproduce the process, and the results will be sent to your email. Following 
            delivery, this data will also be deleted from the system. <br><br>
            The intent of this study is to improve awareness and strengthen defenses against 
            increasingly sophisticated phishing techniques.
